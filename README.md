# neut-ns3-code

Couple of Note to use this code:
 - The code is compatible with ns-3.33 release
 - The files should be placed in "ns-allinone-3.33/ns-3.33/scratch/" directory
 - In the CMakeLists.txt you need to update "include_directories" and "link_directories" for the ns3 libraries according to the ns3-path on your machine
