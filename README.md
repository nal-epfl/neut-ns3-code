# neut-ns3-code

Couple of Note to use this code:
 - The code is compatible with ns-3.36.1 release
 - The files should be placed in "ns-allinone-3.36.1/ns-3.36.1/scratch/" directory
 - In the CMakeLists.txt you need to update "include_directories" and "link_directories" for the ns3 libraries according to the ns3-path on your machine
 - MainLocalizationEXP.py is the current python script used to run experiments
 
 
 P.S.: for old version that is compatible with ns3 version <= 3.35 please use: https://github.com/zeinabshmeis/neut-ns3-code.git
